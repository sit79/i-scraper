# Webscraper Playground

Retrieving all titles from Iggy Pop's current playlists on the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/b03yblbx).
Based on [Bello Gbadebo's](https://github.com/Gbahdeyboh) tutorial [_How To Scrape a Website Using Node.js and Puppeteer_](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-scrape-a-website-using-node-js-and-puppeteer?utm_campaign=how-to-scrape-a-website-using-node-&-pup).

# Launching on Ubuntu

In case you're running this on Ubuntu and the puppeteer brower doesn't launch, this might help:

> wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb

> sudo apt install ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
